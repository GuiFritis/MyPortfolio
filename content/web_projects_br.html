        Here are some of the web projects I have done:
    </h2>    
    <div class="games">

            <img class="game-gif" src="media/MusicPlayerReact.gif" alt="A gif showing a bit of the project"/>
            <h3 class="game-title">Spotify Music Player</h3>
            <p class="game-description scrollable">
                This project was my first project with react I build it with the help of a tutorial, but using 
                my own style.<br/>
                <br/>
                The project logs in to your spotify account and lets you control your music through it.<br/>
            </p>
        </a>
        <a href="javascript:;" target="_blank" class="game-card card">
            <img class="game-gif" src="media/Tree Skill Maker.gif" alt="A gif showing a bit of the project"/>
            <h3 class="game-title">Tree Skill Maker</h3>
            <p class="game-description scrollable">
                This project I developed using PHP, MySQL, jQuery, CSS, HTML5 and Bootstrap.<br/>
                <br/>
                I have searched for a tool that is build for the design of tree skills, but I never found one that
                delivered what I wanted, so I developed this one to fill my needs and also practice. <br/>
