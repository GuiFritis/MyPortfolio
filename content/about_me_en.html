            My strengths are in 2D games for PC using Unity,
            but I have already developed 3D games, mobile and using Unreal.
        </p>
        <p>
            I am graduated in Development and Analyses of Systems, and I've worked for some years
            with Full Stack Development. 
        </p>
        <p> 
            I am always completing courses and improving my knowledge in games.
            Making games brings a good sensation of acomplishment and joy, knowing that people
            have the opportunity to apreciate the experience created, that's why I love it.
        </p>

            Besides programming and developing games, I also write some music in my free time,
            I really love art, and I find it very pleasent to create art, I have managed to connect
            mt taste for game and music in a mobile experience, but I haven't published it.
        </p>

            I am also a scout, dealing with children on most saturdays.
            And through scoutism I can live various experiences and meet diverse people.

            And last but not least, on the weekends I am a player in a Dungeons & Dragons campaign.
