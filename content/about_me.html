        <h2 class="content-subtitle">Hi, I’m Guilherme Fritis!</h2>
        <h3>
            I’m a <span class="contrast">Game Programmer</span> from Brazil. 
        </h3>
        <p>
            I’ve had the experience of developing several games on my own, 
            taking charge of every stage of these projects.
        </p>
        <p>
            My strengths are in 2D games using Unity, 
            though I’ve also developed 3D and have experience with Unreal Engine.
        </p>
        <p>
            I am graduated in Development and Analyses of Systems, and I've worked for some years
            with Full Stack Development. 
        </p>
        <p> 
            I'm constantly taking courses to improve my knowledge 
            in game development. Making games gives me a great sense of accomplishment and joy, 
            especially knowing that people can enjoy the experiences I create. That’s why I love it.
        </p>
        <p>
            In addition to programming, I compose music in my free time. 
            I have a passion for art and enjoy creating it. 
            I've even managed to combine my love for games and music in a mobile project, 
            though it hasn’t been published yet.
        </p>
        <p>
            I’m also a scout leader, working with kids most Saturdays. 
            Through scouting, I experience a variety of adventures and meet diverse people.
        </p>
        <p>
            Last but not least, I’m an Pathfinder player in a campaign on weekends.
