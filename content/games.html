                        Esse jogo foi desenvolvido em uma semana para a <i>Brackeys Game Jam</i>, 
                        o game design e a programação foram totalmente feitos por mim usando Unity.<br/>
                        Os sprites e audio eu usei da Unity Asset Store.<br/>
                        <br/>
                        Underground is a game where the player is in a cave going deeper underground, and by doing so
                        worlds are uncovered showing that there is more underneath the surface.<br/>
                        <br/>
                        The genre of the game is platform roguelite, so you go as far as you can and repeat, every run
                        being randomly generated, your goal is to reach as far as you can.<br/>

                This game was made with the playlist "<i>Making Your First Game in Unreal Engine 4</i>" 
                from <i>Ryan Laley</i>, using the assets and following the steps in these tutorials 
                with some aditional features of my own.<br/>
                <br/>
                In the game you are in a maze and must find the golden platform to escape, avoiding traps 
                and using keys to unlock your way.<br/>
