            <p class="game-description scrollable">
                This game was developed in one week for the <i>Brackeys Game Jam</i>, the concept, game design and 
                scripts were entirely done by me using Unity, the sprites and audio I got from the 
                Asset store.<br/>
                <br/>
                Underground is a game where the player is in a cave going deeper underground, and by doing so
                worlds are uncovered showing that there is more underneath the surface.<br/>
                <br/>
                The genre of the game is platform roguelite, so you go as far as you can and repeat, every run
                being randomly generated, your goal is to reach as far as you can.<br/>

                This game was made with the playlist "<i>Making Your First Game in Unreal Engine 4</i>" 
                from <i>Ryan Laley</i>, using the assets and following the steps in these tutorials 
                with some aditional features of my own.<br/>
