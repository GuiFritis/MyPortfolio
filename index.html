                        I made all of the development in the game, the art and inicial concept was given to me,

                        This game I made in my Unity development course with the help of the instructor.
                        Though, some of the developments and ideas came from me.<br/>

                        This game I also made in my Unity development course with the help of the instructor.
                        I've put a lot of original features in the game as it was my final game for the course.<br/>
                        <br/>
                        Astronault vs Slimes is a 3D adventure-shotting game that we can call a continuation from the 2D version.<br/>
                        <br/>
                        In this game you can scroll through 2 types of weapons each with it's own ammo and recharge rate.
                        The goal of the game is to kill the boss in the end, and collect as many coins as you can.
